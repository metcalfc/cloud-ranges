# cloud-ranges
Python Script to Get AWS, GCP, and Azure IP ranges

# Whats in here?

## get_updates.py

This script will get the IP ranges from AWS, GCP and Azure (Azure, Gov, and China) and put them in output.txt. 
Individual ranges can be found in `lists`.

## exploder.py

Sometimes you don't need ranges you actually need all of the IPs in a range. This is an example of how to
explode the Azure ranges.
